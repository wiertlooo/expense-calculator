# Project by: Wiktor Matulewicz

## Tech Stack:
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- Tailwind CSS

## Dependencies:
- Redux Toolkit
- json-server
- react-icons
- Formik
- react-router-dom

 ### Project Goal:
The main objective of the project was to successfully fetch data from the server using Redux Toolkit Query (RTQ).


### Getting Started:
1. After downloading the project, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. To start the project, run the following commands in two separate terminal windows:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    ```bash
    npm run start:server
    ```
    The second command is responsible for running json-server on port 3005.

### Project Overview:
The app's functionality is straightforward. Navigate to the "Expenses" tab, where you can add dates and associated expenses. Each date panel displays the summed value of all expenses for that date. Additional expenses can be added using the "+" icon. To delete expenses, expand the date panel by clicking the right arrow and delete individual entries.
